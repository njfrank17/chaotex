# ChaotEX  

*Turn dumps of data into structured insights for training and meaningful content to share.*  

## Status  

Currently in early planning *(11-30-2025)*  

**NOT STABLE** 

## Goals  

- Upload and store on-the-fly recordings collected chaotically during high-pressure and fast-moving environments.  
- Review, analyze, annotate, and tag data in a way designed to organize the data for training material and content creation.  
- Generate training and content materials.  
- In later phases, leverage AI to assist with pattern recognition, analysis, and material generation.  

## Inspiration  

Two main things inspired me for this project.  

1. Current Career Experience  
2. Learning New Hobbies  

I have been working in a role where I get to design and implement GNSS and sonar systems for use in the marine construction industry.  Due to the high-pressure situations where time is money, it isn't always possible to build training material for custom technical solutions in real time.  But you can screen-record, take pictures, and record audio, and you still need to generate training and marketing material.  

I also started skydiving in May 2025. About 90 jumps in (and Wisconsin winter upon us), I started spending some more time in the indoor skydiving training tunnel.  I have 10 tunnel videos that I will use for the pilot dataset for ChaotEX.  Eventually, the goal is to use ChaotEX for real skydiving videos as well.  Due to the fast-paced environment of skydiving, where daylight and weather conditions determine how many jumps you can get, sometimes you have to reflect on jump videos later on, not in real time.
